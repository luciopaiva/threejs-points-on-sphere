# Points on sphere

This is a three.js experiment to plot random points on the surface of a sphere. It is based on Bruno Simon's [Three.js Journey course](https://threejs-journey.com/), lesson 17.

I'm using [Mulberry32](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47593316/778272) for the random number generator instead of Math.random() in order to be able to use a seed and get reproducible results.

I replaced lil-gui with [Tweakpane](https://tweakpane.github.io/) for the GUI. I'm also using its [essential plugins](https://github.com/tweakpane/plugin-essentials).

## Setup and run

```bash
nvm i
npm i
npm run dev
```
